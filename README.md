Trello Exporter
===============

Export your Trello content to a readable CSV format with this Google Chrome extension. You can package it yourself in development mode or install it the easy way from [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/trello-csv-converter/aailfmcmlniknbllmbbkipnfphiejmja).

At the moment it only supports checklists and the CSV-format, more features will be available soon!

All processing is done within your Chrome browser, no information will be send to third-party servers, so your data is safe :)

1. Open a board or card
2. Click on 'Export JSON', hidden under 'More...'
